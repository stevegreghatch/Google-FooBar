Skipping Work
=============

Commander Lambda is all about efficiency, including using her bunny "workers" for manual labor. But no one's been properly monitoring the labor shifts for a while and they've gotten quite mixed up. You've been given the task of fixing them, but after you wrote up new shifts you realized that some bunny workers had been transferred to a different area and aren't available for their assigned shifts. Manually sorting through each shift list to compare against work area lists will take forever -- remember, Commander Lambda loves efficiency!

Given two almost identical lists of worker IDs x and y where one of the lists contains an additional ID, write a function solution(x, y) that compares the lists and returns the additional ID.

For example, given the lists x = [13, 5, 6, 2, 5] and y = [5, 2, 5, 13], the function solution(x, y) would return 6 because the list x contains the integer 6 and the list y doesn't. Given the lists x = [14, 27, 1, 4, 2, 50, 3, 1] and y = [2, 4, -4, 3, 1, 1, 14, 27, 50], the function solution(x, y) would return -4 because the list y contains the integer -4 and the list x doesn't.

In each test case, the lists x and y will always contain n non-unique integers where n is at least 1 but never more than 99, and one of the lists will contain an additional unique integer which should be returned by the function. The same n non-unique integers will be present on both lists, but they might appear in a different order like in the examples above. Commander Lambda likes to keep the numbers short, so every worker ID will be between -1000 and 1000.

-4

Elevator Maintenance
====================

You've been assigned the onerous task of elevator maintenance -- ugh! It wouldn't be so bad, except that all the elevator documentation has been lying in a disorganized pile at the bottom of a filing cabinet for years, and you don't even know what elevator version numbers you'll be working on. 

Elevator versions are represented by a series of numbers, divided up into major, minor and revision integers. New versions of an elevator increase the major number, e.g. 1, 2, 3, and so on. When new features are added to an elevator without being a complete new version, a second number named "minor" can be used to represent those new additions, e.g. 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, etc. Small fixes or maintenance work can be represented by a third number named "revision", e.g. 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.0, and so on. The number zero can be used as a major for pre-release versions of elevators, e.g. 0.1, 0.5, 0.9.2, etc (Commander Lambda is careful to always beta test her new technology, with her loyal henchmen as subjects!).

Given a list of elevator versions represented as strings, write a function solution(l) that returns the same list sorted in ascending order by major, minor, and revision number so that you can identify the current elevator version. The versions in list l will always contain major numbers, but minor and revision numbers are optional. If the version contains a revision number, then it will also have a minor number.

For example, given the list l as ["1.1.2", "1.0", "1.3.3", "1.0.12", "1.0.2"], the function solution(l) would return the list ["1.0", "1.0.2", "1.0.12", "1.1.2", "1.3.3"]. If two or more versions are equivalent but one version contains more numbers than the others, then these versions must be sorted ascending based on how many numbers they have, e.g ["1", "1.0", "1.0.0"]. The number of elements in the list l will be at least 1 and will not exceed 100.

Braille Translation
===================

Because Commander Lambda is an equal-opportunity despot, they have several visually-impaired minions. But Lambda never bothered to follow intergalactic standards for workplace accommodations, so those minions have a hard time navigating her space station. You figure printing out Braille signs will help them, and -- since you'll be promoting efficiency at the same time -- increase your chances of a promotion. 

Braille is a writing system used to read by touch instead of by sight. Each character is composed of 6 dots in a 2x3 grid, where each dot can either be a bump or be flat (no bump). You plan to translate the signs around the space station to Braille so that the minions under Commander Lambda's command can feel the bumps on the signs and "read" the text with their touch. The special printer which can print the bumps onto the signs expects the dots in the following order:
1 4
2 5
3 6

So given the plain text word "code", you get the Braille dots:

11 10 11 10
00 01 01 01
00 10 00 00

where 1 represents a bump and 0 represents no bump.  Put together, "code" becomes the output string "100100101010100110100010".

Write a function solution(plaintext) that takes a string parameter and returns a string of 1's and 0's representing the bumps and absence of bumps in the input string. Your function should be able to encode the 26 lowercase letters, handle capital letters by adding a Braille capitalization mark before that character, and use a blank character (000000) for spaces. All signs on the space station are less than fifty characters long and use only letters and spaces.

Please Pass the Coded Messages
==============================

You need to pass a message to the bunny workers, but to avoid detection, the code you agreed to use is... obscure, to say the least. The bunnies are given food on standard-issue plates that are stamped with the numbers 0-9 for easier sorting, and you need to combine sets of plates to create the numbers in the code. The signal that a number is part of the code is that it is divisible by 3. You can do smaller numbers like 15 and 45 easily, but bigger numbers like 144 and 414 are a little trickier. Write a program to help yourself quickly create large numbers for use in the code, given a limited number of plates to work with.

You have L, a list containing some digits (0 to 9). Write a function solution(L) which finds the largest number that can be made from some or all of these digits and is divisible by 3. If it is not possible to make such a number, return 0 as the solution. L will contain anywhere from 1 to 9 digits.  The same digit may appear multiple times in the list, but each element in the list may only be used once.

Power Hungry
============

Commander Lambda's space station is HUGE. And huge space stations take a LOT of power. Huge space stations with doomsday devices take even more power. To help meet the station's power needs, Commander Lambda has installed solar panels on the station's outer surface. But the station sits in the middle of a quasar quantum flux field, which wreaks havoc on the solar panels. You and your team of henchmen have been assigned to repair the solar panels, but you'd rather not take down all of the panels at once if you can help it, since they do help power the space station and all!

You need to figure out which sets of panels in any given array you can take offline to repair while still maintaining the maximum amount of power output per array, and to do THAT, you'll first need to figure out what the maximum output of each array actually is. Write a function solution(xs) that takes a list of integers representing the power output levels of each panel in an array, and returns the maximum product of some non-empty subset of those numbers. So for example, if an array contained panels with power output levels of [2, -3, 1, 0, -5], then the maximum product would be found by taking the subset: xs[0] = 2, xs[1] = -3, xs[4] = -5, giving the product 2*(-3)*(-5) = 30.  So solution([2,-3,1,0,-5]) will be "30".

Each array of solar panels contains at least 1 and no more than 50 panels, and each panel will have a power output level whose absolute value is no greater than 1000 (some panels are malfunctioning so badly that they're draining energy, but you know a trick with the panels' wave stabilizer that lets you combine two negative-output panels to produce the positive output of the multiple of their power values). The final products may be very large, so give the solution as a string representation of the number.
